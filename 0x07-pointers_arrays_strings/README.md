# C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

This project is part of a series of exercises to deepen understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. It covers various advanced concepts and techniques for manipulating these data structures.

## Description

The project involves implementing several functions that perform operations on pointers, arrays, and strings. Each function is designed to reinforce different aspects of these topics, such as memory management, pointer arithmetic, and string manipulation.

## Requirements

- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation**: The code is compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following options:
  - `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Style**: Code must adhere to the Betty style guide and will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **Files**: All files should end with a new line.
- **No Standard Library**: Usage of standard library functions such as `printf` and `puts` is forbidden. Only `_putchar` is allowed.
- **Global Variables**: Global variables are not allowed.
- **Functions**: No more than 5 functions per file.
