Project: More Functions, More Nested Loops (C)
Description:
This program demonstrates the use of functions and nested loops in C programming language. It showcases various examples of functions, including those with multiple parameters, return types, and nested loops to perform complex tasks.

Features:
Multiple functions with different parameters and return types
Nested loops for iterating through arrays and performing calculations
Examples of functions with void return type and those with return values
Demonstration of function calls and parameter passing.
